      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Dustin Wei is a Ph.D. candidate in College of Computing and Data Science at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working jointly with A*STAR SIMTech and the Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR). His research lies at the intersection of evolutionary computation, Bayesian optimization, and generative modeling, with a focus on multi-objective and multi-task optimization. He has published as first author in top-tier venues including IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation (TEC), and has received multiple international optimization competition awards at GECCO, WCCI, and CEC. His current work explores scalable generative frameworks for black-box optimization, with diverse applications in automated design and AI-driven discovery.
